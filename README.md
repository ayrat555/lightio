LightIO is a ruby networking library, that combines ruby fiber and fast IO event loop.

The intent of LightIO is to provide ruby stdlib compatible modules, that user can use these modules instead stdlib, to gain the benefits of IO event loop without care any details about react or async programming.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki/Current-status-and-roadmap) to get more information.

LightIO is build upon [nio4r](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r). Get heavily inspired by [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/), [async-io](https://github.com/socketry/async-io).

## Usage

require 'lightio'

start = Time.now

beams = 1000.times.map do
  # LightIO::Beam is a thread-like executor, use it instead Thread
  LightIO::Beam.new do
    # do some io operations in beam
    LightIO.sleep(1)
  end
end

beams.each(&:join)
seconds = Time.now - start
puts "1000 beams take #{seconds - 1} seconds to create"
```
