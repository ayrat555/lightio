LightIO is a ruby concurrency networking library, that combines ruby fiber and fast IO event loop.

* **Simple**, LightIO provide same API with ruby stdlib, from low level to high level, use `LightIO::Thread` to start green threads, use `LightIO::Socket` `LightIO::TCPServer` for IO operations.
* **Transparent**, LightIO encourage user to write multi threads and blocking-IO style code, LightIO will transfer actual IO operations to inner IO loop.
* **Monkey patch**(experiment), LightIO provide reversible monkey patch, call `LightIO::Monkey.patch_all!` to apply, it will let LightIO inner loop to take over all IO operations, and patch threads to light weight fibers.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki/Current-status-and-roadmap) to get more information.

LightIO is build upon [nio4r](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r). Get heavily inspired by [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/), [async-io](https://github.com/socketry/async-io).
